## Timestamp Verification Methods

This document outlines various methods to ensure tamper-proof timestamps for data submissions.

## 1. Blockchain for Tamper-Proof Timestamps

### Hyperledger Fabric
- An open-source blockchain framework that allows you to create immutable, tamper-proof records for timestamps.
- You can log each transaction (e.g., user data submission) with a timestamp on the blockchain.

### Ethereum
- Create a simple smart contract on Ethereum to store hashed timestamp records and verify integrity.
- Tools like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) can help you develop and test these contracts.

### OpenTimestamps
- A lightweight, open-source tool specifically designed for creating and verifying timestamp proofs using the Bitcoin blockchain.

## 2. Digital Signatures for Timestamping

### OpenSSL
- Use OpenSSL to sign the timestamp and data at the point of submission.
- This ensures that the timestamp and associated data haven’t been tampered with, which can be verified server-side.

### Libsodium
- A simpler, easier-to-use library for cryptographic operations, including signing and verifying data with timestamps.

## 3. Server-Side Time Validation

### NTP (Network Time Protocol)
- Use `ntpd` or `chrony` to sync your server’s clock with accurate network time.
- Always log timestamps on the server side when receiving data to ensure consistent, verified timestamps.
